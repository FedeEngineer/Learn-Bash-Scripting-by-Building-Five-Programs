# Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs üöÄ

## Overview  
This repository contains scripts and notes from the course **"Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs."** This 220-lesson course explores how to write and execute Bash scripts by combining terminal commands and programming logic.  

## What I Learned üìñ  
Throughout the course, I developed a deeper understanding of:  
- Essential terminal commands and their usage in scripts.  
- Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions in Bash.  
- Automating tasks and executing scripts efficiently.  
- Debugging and improving script performance.  
- Building five small programs to reinforce these concepts.  

## Projects üõ†Ô∏è  
During the course, I created five practical programs that demonstrate different scripting techniques. These projects helped solidify my understanding of Bash scripting fundamentals.  

## How to Use the Scripts  
To run any script from this repository:  
1. Open a terminal.  
2. Navigate to the script's directory using `cd`.  
3. Make the script executable (if needed) using:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```  
4. Run the script with:  
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```  

## Future Improvements ‚ú®  
This course was a great introduction to Bash scripting, and I plan to:  
- Optimize scripts for better performance.  
- Explore more advanced Bash scripting techniques.  
- Integrate Bash scripts with other technologies like Python and databases.
